### üîπ Advanced RLHF 2.0 Methods

1. **PPO-RLHF (Baseline)**

   * Reward Model trained from pairwise human preferences
   * Policy optimized to maximize reward with KL regularization

2. **DPO ‚Äî Direct Preference Optimization**

   * No reward model ‚Äî directly optimizes policy from preference data
   * Derived from the **policy improvement step** in PPO-RLHF
   * Objective:
     [
     L_{\text{DPO}}(\pi) = \mathbb{E}*{(x,y^+,y^-)}\left[ \log \sigma(\beta(\log \pi(y^+|x) - \log \pi(y^-|x)) - \log \frac{\pi*{\text{ref}}(y^+|x)}{\pi_{\text{ref}}(y^-|x)}) ) \right]
     ]
   * Benefits: Stable, no reward model needed, lower compute

3. **GRPO ‚Äî Group Relative Policy Optimization**

   * Extends PPO for group comparisons instead of pairwise
   * Uses **relative ranking** within a group of completions
   * Better gradient signal when many completions exist for the same prompt
   * Reduces reward variance and improves sample efficiency
   * Ideal for **LLM alignment** with multi-output feedback

4. **ORPO ‚Äî Odds Ratio Policy Optimization**
