|-------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Bent Identity**       | (-∞, ∞)         | Regression tasks                          | Smooth, unbounded, non-linear                | Rarely used, computationally expensive    |
| **Maxout**              | (-∞, ∞)         | Piecewise linear modeling                 | Flexible, avoids vanishing gradients         | Many parameters, computationally expensive |
| **GLU**                 | (-∞, ∞)         | NLP (Transformer variants)                | Learnable gating, context-aware             | Computationally expensive, more parameters |
| **Snake**               | (-∞, ∞)         | Periodic data modeling                    | Captures periodicity, smooth                 | Niche, computationally expensive           |

### Key Mathematical Concepts
- **Non-Linearity**: All functions introduce non-linearity, enabling complex pattern modeling.
- **Smoothness**: Bent Identity, GLU, and Snake are fully differentiable; Maxout is piecewise linear and non-differentiable at transition points.
- **Gating**: GLU uses a sigmoid gate to modulate inputs, adding context sensitivity.
- **Periodicity**: Snake’s trigonometric component makes it unique for periodic data.
- **Flexibility**: Maxout’s ability to learn piecewise linear functions makes it highly adaptable.

### Practical Considerations
- **Bent Identity**: Rarely used but suitable for regression tasks requiring smooth outputs.
- **Maxout**: Powerful but parameter-heavy, less common in modern architectures.
- **GLU**: Effective in NLP tasks where gating improves feature selection.
- **Snake**: Specialized for periodic data, with limited general applicability.
