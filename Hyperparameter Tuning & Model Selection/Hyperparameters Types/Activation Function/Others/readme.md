## Summary and Comparison

| **Activation Function** | **Range**          | **Use Case**                              | **Advantages**                              | **Problems**                              |
|-------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Step**                | {0, 1}            | Binary classifiers (perceptrons)          | Simple, binary decisions                    | Non-differentiable, limited expressiveness |
| **Identity**            | (-∞, ∞)           | Regression (output layer)                 | Simple, unbounded, constant gradient        | No non-linearity, limited use             |
| **RBF**                 | (0, 1]            | RBF networks                              | Localized, smooth, universal approximation  | Parameter tuning, computationally expensive |
| **Sinc**                | [-0.217, 1]       | Signal processing                         | Oscillatory, zero-centered, smooth          | Niche, computationally expensive           |

### Key Mathematical Concepts
- **Non-Linearity**: Only RBF and Sinc introduce non-linearity; Step is piecewise constant, and Identity is linear.
- **Differentiability**: Identity, RBF, and Sinc are differentiable; Step is not, limiting its use in modern networks.
- **Locality**: RBF’s Gaussian shape makes it sensitive to inputs near a center, ideal for localized responses.
- **Oscillatory Behavior**: Sinc’s wave-like output is unique for signal processing tasks.
- **Sparsity and Simplicity**: Step and Identity are simple but lack the expressiveness needed for deep networks.

### Practical Considerations
- **Step**: Obsolete in modern deep learning due to non-differentiability but historically significant.
- **Identity**: Standard for regression output layers but not for hidden layers.
- **RBF**: Specialized for RBF networks, requiring careful parameter tuning.
- **Sinc**: Niche for oscillatory data, rarely used in general-purpose networks.
