# üéØ What is SwiGLU?

**SwiGLU** stands for **Swish-Gated Linear Unit**. It‚Äôs a **gating mechanism** used within feedforward blocks in modern transformer architectures (like **PaLM**, **T5**, etc.). It combines ideas from **gating mechanisms** (like GLU) and the **Swish activation function**.

SwiGLU is designed to improve the expressiveness and non-linearity of the **feedforward neural networks (FFN)** within transformers by applying an element-wise gating mechanism controlled by **Swish activations**.

---

# üî¨ Mathematical Definition

Given an input vector $x$, SwiGLU applies:

$$
\text{SwiGLU}(x) = (\text{Linear}_1(x) \odot \text{Swish}(\text{Linear}_2(x)))
$$

Where:

* $\odot$ is element-wise (Hadamard) multiplication.
* $\text{Linear}_1(x)$ and $\text{Linear}_2(x)$ are separate learned linear projections.
* $\text{Swish}(x) = x \cdot \sigma(x)$, with $\sigma(x)$ being the sigmoid function.

---

### Simplified Formula:

If:

* $a = \text{Linear}_1(x)$
* $b = \text{Linear}_2(x)$

Then:

$$
\text{SwiGLU}(x) = a \odot (b \cdot \sigma(b))
$$

Because:

* $\text{Swish}(b) = b \cdot \sigma(b)$

# üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Computation

1. **Input**: $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$
2. **Projection 1**: $a = W_a x + b_a$
3. **Projection 2**: $b = W_b x + b_b$
4. **Activation**: Apply Swish to $b$: $b' = b \cdot \sigma(b)$
5. **Gating**: Multiply $a$ and $b'$ element-wise:

   
   $\text{Output} = a \odot b'$

---

# üìä Why SwiGLU?

Traditional **Feedforward Networks (FFN)** inside transformers typically use:

$$
\text{FFN}(x) = \text{ReLU}(\text{Linear}_1(x)) \cdot \text{Linear}_2(x)
$$

However:

* ReLU introduces sparsity and lacks negative outputs.
* SwiGLU replaces ReLU-based non-linearity with a **gated mechanism**.
* Gating with Swish allows more **smooth, non-linear gating**, better controlling the flow of activations.

This leads to:

* Improved model capacity without large parameter increases.
* Better gradient flow due to smooth derivatives.
* Empirical improvements in large language models and transformers.

# üìà Mathematical Properties

* **Non-linear gating** (Swish provides smooth, non-monotonic gating).
* **Element-wise multiplicative interaction** between two learned projections.
* **Differentiable everywhere** (due to Swish and matrix multiplication).
* **Output Dimension**: Same as $a$ and $b$ ‚Äî usually intermediate dimension in transformers (e.g., 4√ó hidden dimension).

# ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Example (PyTorch)

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class SwiGLU(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim):
        super(SwiGLU, self).__init__()
        self.linear1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.linear2 = nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        a = self.linear1(x)                      # Linear projection
        b = self.linear2(x)                      # Second projection
        b_swish = b * torch.sigmoid(b)           # Swish activation
        return a * b_swish                       # Element-wise gating
```

**Key Notes**:

* **Two parallel linear layers** process the input.
* Output shape matches hidden\_dim.
* SwiGLU is typically followed by another linear layer projecting back to input dimension.

# üèóÔ∏è Usage in Transformers

In transformer architectures:

* SwiGLU typically replaces ReLU or GeLU inside feedforward blocks.
* Example in Transformer FFN:

  1. SwiGLU gating (`hidden_dim` ‚Üí 4√ó `hidden_dim`).
  2. Project back (`hidden_dim`).

It‚Äôs used like:

```python
class TransformerFFN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_dim, ffn_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.swiglu = SwiGLU(hidden_dim, ffn_dim)
        self.proj_out = nn.Linear(ffn_dim, hidden_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.proj_out(self.swiglu(x))
```
