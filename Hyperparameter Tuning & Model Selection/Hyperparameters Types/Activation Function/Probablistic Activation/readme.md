| **Activation Function** | **Range**        | **Use Case**                              | **Advantages**                              | **Problems**                              |
|-------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Softmax**             | [0, 1] (sums to 1) | Multi-class classification, attention     | Interpretable probabilities, differentiable  | Non-sparse, computationally expensive      |
| **Sparsemax**           | [0, 1] (sums to 1) | Sparse attention mechanisms               | Sparse outputs, robust to outliers          | Complex implementation, limited adoption   |
| **Gumbel-Softmax**      | [0, 1] (sums to 1) | Discrete latent variables in VAEs         | Differentiable sampling, flexible           | Complex, temperature-sensitive, expensive  |

### Key Mathematical Concepts
- **Probability Distribution**: All three functions produce outputs that sum to 1, forming valid probability distributions.
- **Differentiability**: Softmax and Gumbel-Softmax are fully differentiable; Sparsemax is differentiable where outputs are non-zero.
- **Sparsity**: Sparsemax promotes sparse distributions, while Softmax and Gumbel-Softmax (with high \(\tau\)) produce dense distributions.
- **Stochasticity**: Gumbel-Softmax introduces randomness via Gumbel noise, enabling differentiable sampling for discrete variables.
- **Normalization**: All functions normalize outputs to the probability simplex, ensuring valid probabilities.

### Practical Considerations
- **Softmax**: The standard for multi-class classification and attention mechanisms due to its simplicity and interpretability.
- **Sparsemax**: Useful in attention-based models where sparsity is desired, but requires custom implementation in many frameworks.
- **Gumbel-Softmax**: Ideal for generative models with discrete latent variables, but its performance depends heavily on the temperature \(\tau\).
