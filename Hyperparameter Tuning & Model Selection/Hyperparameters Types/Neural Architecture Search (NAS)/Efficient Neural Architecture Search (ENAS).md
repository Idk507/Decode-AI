Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS) and ProxylessNAS are two advanced methods in Neural Architecture Search (NAS) designed to address the high computational cost of earlier approaches like RL-based NAS (e.g., NASNet). Both methods aim to make NAS more practical by reducing search time and resource requirements while maintaining or improving the quality of discovered architectures. Below, I provide a detailed explanation of ENAS and ProxylessNAS, covering their motivation, methodology, key innovations, mathematical formulation, challenges, applications, and comparisons.

## **Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS)**

ENAS, introduced in the 2018 paper *"Efficient Neural Architecture Search via Parameter Sharing"* by Pham et al., is an RL-based NAS method that significantly improves efficiency over earlier approaches like NASNet by introducing **weight sharing**. ENAS reduces the computational cost of evaluating candidate architectures by training a single "super-network" that encompasses all possible architectures in the search space, allowing sub-architectures to share weights. This makes ENAS orders of magnitude faster than traditional RL-based NAS.

### **Motivation for ENAS**
- **High computational cost of RL-based NAS**: Methods like NASNet required training thousands of architectures from scratch, costing thousands of GPU hours (e.g., ~500 GPUs for 4 days).
- **Inefficiency in evaluation**: Repeatedly training and evaluating architectures is redundant since many architectures share similar components (e.g., convolutional layers).
- **Scalability**: ENAS aims to make NAS feasible for researchers with limited computational resources by reducing search time to hours (e.g., ~10 GPU hours on CIFAR-10).
- **Preserving performance**: ENAS seeks to maintain the high performance of RL-based NAS while improving efficiency.

### **Key Components of ENAS**

1. **Search Space**:
   - ENAS typically uses a **cell-based search space**, similar to NASNet, where architectures are constructed by stacking repeatable "cells."
   - **Cells**:
     - **Normal Cell**: Preserves input dimensions for feature extraction.
     - **Reduction Cell**: Reduces spatial dimensions (e.g., via striding or pooling).
   - Each cell is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with nodes representing feature maps and edges representing operations (e.g., 3x3 convolution, 5x5 convolution, max pooling, skip connection).
   - The search space defines a set of possible operations for each edge, allowing flexible architecture design.

2. **Search Strategy**:
   - ENAS uses a **reinforcement learning (RL) controller**, typically an RNN, to sample architectures from the search space.
   - The controller generates a sequence of decisions (e.g., "use a 3x3 convolution, followed by a skip connection") to construct a cell.
   - Unlike traditional RL-based NAS, ENAS employs **weight sharing** to evaluate architectures efficiently (see below).

3. **Performance Estimation**:
   - Instead of training each sampled architecture from scratch, ENAS trains a single **super-network** that contains all possible architectures in the search space.
   - Sub-architectures share weights within the super-network, allowing rapid evaluation.
   - The performance (e.g., validation accuracy) of a sampled architecture is used as the reward to update the RL controller.

### **How ENAS Works**

ENAS reformulates the NAS process by introducing weight sharing, making it highly efficient. The workflow is as follows:

1. **Construct the Super-Network**:
   - The super-network is a single neural network that encompasses all possible architectures in the search space.
   - For example, in a cell-based search space, the super-network includes all possible operations (e.g., convolutions, pooling) on each edge of the cell’s DAG, with shared weights for each operation.

2. **Train the Controller**:
   - An RNN-based controller samples architectures by generating a sequence of operations and connections for each cell.
   - The controller’s policy is parameterized by \(\theta\), and it outputs a probability distribution over actions (e.g., selecting a 3x3 convolution).
   - The controller is trained using **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**, a stable RL algorithm, to maximize the expected reward.

3. **Weight Sharing**:
   - When the controller samples an architecture, it is evaluated by selecting a sub-network from the super-network.
   - The sub-network uses the shared weights of the super-network, avoiding the need to train from scratch.
   - The super-network is trained iteratively by sampling different architectures and updating the shared weights using gradient descent on the training set.

4. **Evaluate Performance**:
   - The sampled architecture is evaluated on a validation set to compute a reward (e.g., validation accuracy).
   - The reward is used to update the controller’s policy, encouraging it to sample better-performing architectures.

5. **Alternate Training**:
   - ENAS alternates between:
     - **Updating the super-network weights (\(w\))**: Train the super-network on the training set using gradient descent for a fixed number of iterations.
     - **Updating the controller (\(\theta\))**: Sample architectures, evaluate their performance using the super-network, and update the controller using PPO based on the reward.
   - This process continues until convergence or a fixed number of iterations.

6. **Architecture Selection**:
   - After the search, the controller samples the architecture with the highest reward (e.g., best validation accuracy).
   - The selected architecture is trained from scratch on the target dataset to obtain the final model.

7. **Transferability**:
   - The discovered cells can be scaled (e.g., by stacking more cells or increasing channel width) and transferred to other tasks or datasets (e.g., from CIFAR-10 to ImageNet).

### **Mathematical Formulation**

ENAS can be formalized as an RL problem with weight sharing:

- **State (\(s_t\))**: The current state of the architecture being constructed (e.g., the operations chosen so far in the cell).
- **Action (\(a_t\))**: The next decision in the architecture (e.g., selecting a 3x3 convolution or a skip connection).
- **Policy (\(\pi(a_t | s_t; \theta)\))**: The controller’s policy, parameterized by \(\theta\), which outputs the probability of taking action \(a_t\) in state \(s_t\).
- **Reward (\(R\))**: The performance of the sampled architecture (e.g., validation accuracy).
- **Objective**: Maximize the expected reward:
  \[
  J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi_\theta} [R]
  \]
- **Weight Sharing**: The super-network’s weights \(w\) are shared across all sampled architectures. The super-network is trained to minimize the training loss:
  \[
  \min_w \mathcal{L}_{\text{train}}(w, a)
  \]
  where \(a\) is the sampled architecture.
- **Controller Update**: The controller is updated using PPO, which approximates the policy gradient:
  \[
  L^{\text{PPO}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_t \left[ \min \left( r_t(\theta) \hat{A}_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon) \hat{A}_t \right) \right]
  \]
  where \(r_t(\theta) = \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t | s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(a_t | s_t)}\) is the probability ratio, \(\hat{A}_t\) is the advantage (reward minus baseline), and \(\epsilon\) is a clipping parameter.

### **Key Innovations in ENAS**

1. **Weight Sharing**:
   - By training a single super-network, ENAS avoids training each architecture from scratch, reducing search time from days to hours (e.g., ~10 GPU hours on CIFAR-10).
2. **PPO for Stability**:
   - ENAS uses PPO instead of REINFORCE (used in NASNet), improving the stability of the controller’s training.
3. **Cell-Based Search**:
   - The modular cell-based search space allows discovered architectures to be transferable and scalable.
4. **Efficiency**:
   - ENAS achieves performance comparable to NASNet but with orders of magnitude less computational cost.

### **Results**
- **CIFAR-10**: ENAS achieved a test error of ~2.89% with a search time of ~10 GPU hours, compared to NASNet’s ~2.65% with ~2000 GPU hours.
- **ImageNet**: ENAS architectures transferred to ImageNet achieved competitive performance with manually designed models like ResNet.

## **ProxylessNAS**

ProxylessNAS, introduced in the 2018 paper *"ProxylessNAS: Direct Neural Architecture Search on Target Task and Hardware"* by Cai et al., is a differentiable NAS method that further improves efficiency by directly searching on the target task and hardware, eliminating the need for proxy datasets or models. Unlike DARTS, which uses a super-network with continuous relaxation, ProxylessNAS employs a **path-based approach** to reduce memory overhead and directly optimize for hardware constraints like latency.

### **Motivation for ProxylessNAS**

- **Limitations of proxy-based NAS**: Methods like DARTS and ENAS often use proxy tasks (e.g., smaller datasets like CIFAR-10 or reduced training epochs) to reduce computational cost, but the discovered architectures may not generalize to the target task (e.g., ImageNet) or hardware (e.g., mobile devices).
- **Memory inefficiency in DARTS**: The super-network in DARTS requires storing all possible operations in memory, leading to high GPU memory usage (e.g., 10x the memory of a single architecture).
- **Hardware constraints**: Real-world applications require architectures optimized for specific hardware (e.g., low latency on mobile devices).
- **Direct search**: ProxylessNAS searches directly on the target dataset and hardware, improving generalization and efficiency.

### **Key Components of ProxylessNAS**

1. **Search Space**:
   - ProxylessNAS uses a **path-based search space**, where each layer of the network can select from a set of candidate operations (e.g., different convolutional blocks).
   - The search space is inspired by mobile-friendly architectures like MobileNetV2, including operations like:
     - Inverted residual blocks with different kernel sizes (e.g., 3x3, 5x5).
     - Depthwise separable convolutions.
     - Skip connections.
   - The search space is designed to be hardware-aware, prioritizing operations that are efficient on target devices (e.g., mobile phones, GPUs).

2. **Search Strategy**:
   - ProxylessNAS uses a **differentiable search strategy** similar to DARTS but with a **binary path selection** mechanism to reduce memory usage.
   - Instead of computing a weighted sum of all operations (as in DARTS), ProxylessNAS samples a single path (operation) for each layer during training, using a **binarized architecture parameter**.
   - The architecture parameters (\(\alpha\)) are optimized using gradient descent, but only one operation is active at a time, reducing memory overhead.

3. **Performance Estimation**:
   - ProxylessNAS evaluates architectures directly on the target dataset (e.g., ImageNet) and hardware (e.g., mobile device, GPU).
   - The performance includes both accuracy and hardware-specific metrics (e.g., latency, energy consumption).
   - The reward function combines accuracy and latency using a multi-objective formulation.

### **How ProxylessNAS Works**

ProxylessNAS combines differentiable optimization with hardware-aware search, directly optimizing on the target task. The workflow is as follows:

1. **Define the Search Space**:
   - Each layer in the network can choose from a set of candidate operations (e.g., inverted residual blocks with different kernel sizes).
   - The architecture is represented as a sequence of layers, where each layer selects one operation.

2. **Binarized Path Selection**:
   - For each layer, a set of architecture parameters \(\alpha = \{\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_n\}\) represents the probability of selecting each candidate operation.
   - During training, a single operation is sampled using a **Gumbel-Softmax** distribution or binary gating:
     \[
     p_i = \frac{\exp(\alpha_i)}{\sum_{j=1}^n \exp(\alpha_j)}
     \]
     where \(p_i\) is the probability of selecting operation \(i\).
   - A binary gate \(g_i \in \{0, 1\}\) is sampled, ensuring only one operation is active:
     \[
     g_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p_i)
     \]
   - The output of the layer is:
     \[
     y = \sum_{i=1}^n g_i \cdot o_i(x)
     \]
     where \(o_i(x)\) is the output of operation \(i\), and only one \(g_i = 1\) at a time.

3. **Train the Super-Network**:
   - The super-network is trained on the target dataset, with weights shared across all possible operations.
   - The training alternates between:
     - **Updating network weights (\(w\))**: Optimize the weights of the active operations using gradient descent on the training loss.
     - **Updating architecture parameters (\(\alpha\))**: Optimize \(\alpha\) using gradient descent on a combined loss (e.g., accuracy and latency).

4. **Hardware-Aware Optimization**:
   - The loss function incorporates hardware constraints, such as latency:
     \[
     \mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{accuracy}} + \lambda \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\text{latency}}
     \]
     where \(\lambda\) balances accuracy and latency, and \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{latency}}\) is typically a function of the measured latency on the target hardware.
   - Latency can be estimated using a lookup table or measured directly on the target device.

5. **Architecture Discretization**:
   - After training, the operation with the highest \(\alpha_i\) is selected for each layer:
     \[
     o_i = \arg\max_i \alpha_i
     \]
   - The resulting architecture is a single path through the super-network.

6. **Final Training**:
   - The selected architecture is trained from scratch on the target dataset to obtain the final model.

### **Mathematical Formulation**

ProxylessNAS formulates NAS as a differentiable optimization problem with a focus on memory efficiency and hardware constraints:

- **Architecture Parameters**: For each layer, the architecture parameters \(\alpha = \{\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_n\}\) represent the importance of each operation.
- **Binarized Path**: The output of a layer is:
  \[
  y = \sum_{i=1}^n g_i \cdot o_i(x), \quad g_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}\left(\frac{\exp(\alpha_i)}{\sum_{j=1}^n \exp(\alpha_j)}\right)
  \]
- **Objective**: Minimize a combined loss:
  \[
  \min_{w, \alpha} \mathcal{L}_{\text{train}}(w, \alpha) + \lambda \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\text{latency}}(\alpha)
  \]
  where \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{train}}\) is the training loss (e.g., cross-entropy), and \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{latency}}\) is the latency penalty.
- **Optimization**: Use gradient descent to update \(w\) and \(\alpha\), with binary sampling to reduce memory usage.

### **Key Innovations in ProxylessNAS**

1. **Direct Search on Target Task**:
   - Unlike DARTS or ENAS, which use proxy datasets, ProxylessNAS searches directly on the target dataset (e.g., ImageNet), improving generalization.
2. **Binarized Path Selection**:
   - By sampling a single operation per layer, ProxylessNAS reduces memory usage compared to DARTS, which computes all operations simultaneously.
3. **Hardware-Aware Optimization**:
   - Incorporates latency or other hardware metrics directly into the objective, making it suitable for resource-constrained devices.
4. **Memory Efficiency**:
   - The binary gating mechanism ensures only one operation is active during training, reducing GPU memory requirements.

### **Results**
- **ImageNet**: ProxylessNAS achieved a top-1 accuracy of ~74.6% with a latency of ~78ms on a mobile device, competitive with MobileNetV2 but with a more efficient search process.
- **Search Time**: ~200 GPU hours on ImageNet, significantly less than RL-based methods like NASNet (~2000 GPU hours).
