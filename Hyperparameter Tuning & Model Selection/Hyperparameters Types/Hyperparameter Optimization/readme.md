###  Overview of Hyperparameter Optimization

Hyperparameters are configuration settings for machine learning models that are not learned during training (e.g., learning rate, number of hidden layers, or regularization strength). Hyperparameter optimization involves finding the combination of hyperparameters that maximizes a performance metric (e.g., accuracy, F1 score) or minimizes a loss function on a validation set.

The goal is to optimize an objective function $\( f(\theta) \), where \( \theta \)$ represents the hyperparameter configuration, and  f  is typically the modelâ€™s performance metric evaluated via cross-validation.
