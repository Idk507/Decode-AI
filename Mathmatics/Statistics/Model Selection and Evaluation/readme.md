Model Selection and Evaluation

Bias-Variance Trade-off: Understanding the relationship between model complexity and prediction error.

Cross-Validation: Techniques like k-fold cross-validation to assess model performance on unseen data.

Performance Metrics:

Classification Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and AUC.

Regression Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-Squared.
