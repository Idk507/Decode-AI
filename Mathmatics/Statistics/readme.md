### **Statistics Roadmap for Machine Learning**

Statistics is the backbone of machine learning, providing essential tools to analyze data, model uncertainty, and make informed decisions based on data. A deep understanding of statistical concepts is crucial for implementing and interpreting machine learning models. This roadmap will guide you through the foundational and advanced statistical concepts necessary for machine learning.

#### **1. Introduction to Statistics**

* **What is Statistics?**: Understanding the role of statistics in data analysis and machine learning.
* **Descriptive vs. Inferential Statistics**: Distinguishing between summarizing data (descriptive) and making predictions or inferences from data (inferential).
* **Sampling and Populations**: Basic concepts of populations, samples, and how to draw inferences from samples.
* **Statistical Notation**: Introduction to common statistical symbols, terminology, and conventions.

#### **2. Descriptive Statistics**

* **Measures of Central Tendency**: Mean, median, and mode – methods to summarize the central value of a data set.
* **Measures of Dispersion**: Range, variance, and standard deviation – understanding the spread of data.
* **Shape of Distributions**: Skewness and kurtosis – how the shape of data distributions can inform model choice.
* **Visualization**: Histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to visualize the distribution and relationships between variables.

#### **3. Probability Distributions**

* **Discrete vs. Continuous Distributions**: Understanding the difference and use cases for each.
* **Common Distributions**:

  * **Binomial Distribution**: Key for binary outcomes (e.g., success/failure).
  * **Poisson Distribution**: Modeling count data, especially for rare events.
  * **Normal Distribution**: The foundation of many statistical methods, used to model continuous data.
  * **Exponential and Gamma Distributions**: Used for modeling time until events and other processes.
  * **Multivariate Normal Distribution**: Extending normal distribution to multiple variables.

* **Hypothesis Testing**:

  * Null and alternative hypotheses.
