Advanced Statistical Methods

Generalized Linear Models (GLM): Extending linear models to handle non-normal distributions (e.g., Poisson regression).

Survival Analysis: Analyzing time-to-event data with methods like Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models.

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs): Statistical models for systems that transition between states in a probabilistic manner.

Gaussian Processes: Non-parametric models for regression and classification tasks.
