Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) extend traditional linear regression to accommodate response variables with non-normal distributions, such as binary, count, or skewed data. They provide a flexible framework for modeling relationships between predictors and a response variable while accounting for different data distributions and variance structures. Below, I’ll explain GLMs in detail, including their components, mathematical implementation, and applications, with a focus on Poisson regression as an example.

### **1. Overview of Generalized Linear Models**

GLMs generalize linear regression by allowing the response variable to follow a distribution from the exponential family (e.g., normal, Poisson, binomial, gamma) and by introducing a link function to connect the linear predictor to the mean of the response variable. This makes GLMs suitable for a wide range of data types, unlike linear regression, which assumes normality and constant variance.

#### **Key Components of GLMs**

#### **Exponential Family**
The response variable’s distribution must belong to the exponential family, which has the probability density function (or mass function) of the form:

Examples of exponential family distributions include:
- Normal: For continuous data.
- Poisson: For count data.
- Binomial: For binary or proportion data.
- Gamma: For positive, skewed data.

#### **Link Function**

The choice of link function depends on the distribution and the nature of the response variable. The **canonical link** is a natural choice for each distribution, derived from the exponential family form, but other link functions can be used.

### **2. Mathematical Implementation of GLMs**

To understand GLMs mathematically, let’s break down the model estimation process, focusing on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which is used to estimate the parameters \( \boldsymbol{\beta} \).

#### **Model Specification**

#### **Likelihood Function**

.

#### **Parameter Estimation**
To estimate $\( \boldsymbol{\beta} \)$, we maximize the log-likelihood $\( \ell(\boldsymbol{\beta}) \)$ with respect to $\( \boldsymbol{\beta} \)$. This is typically done using iterative methods like **Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRWLS)** because the likelihood equations are nonlinear.

The score function (gradient of the log-likelihood) is:

IRWLS proceeds as follows:

#### **Goodness of Fit**
- **Deviance**: Measures the difference between the fitted model and the saturated model (a model that perfectly fits the data). For a GLM, deviance is:

<img width="349" height="57" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a779865c-3297-4c94-9c79-df37d42a21f9" />

Lower deviance indicates a better fit.
- **AIC/BIC**: Used for model comparison, balancing fit and complexity.
- **Residuals**: Deviance residuals or Pearson residuals are used to assess model fit.

### **3. Poisson Regression: A Specific GLM**

Poisson regression is a GLM used for modeling count data (e.g., number of events occurring in a fixed interval). It assumes the response variable \( Y \) follows a Poisson distribution:

<img width="388" height="61" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/213ba101-b87d-434d-a19a-60a4f6efd3f8" />

where $\( \lambda = E(Y) = \text{Var}(Y) \)$ .

#### **Poisson Distribution**
The probability mass function is:

<img width="484" height="51" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd94080f-6143-464d-8e99-ba705472d85e" />


In the exponential family form:

Here, $\( \theta = \log(\lambda) \), \( b(\theta) = e^\theta = \lambda \), and \( \phi = 1 \)$ .

#### **Link Function**
The canonical link for the Poisson distribution is the **log link**:

<img width="291" height="101" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4816452b-61c4-480a-9ce0-12d9e1fe2935" />


This ensures $\( \lambda > 0 \)$ , which is appropriate since the Poisson mean must be positive.

#### **Log-Likelihood**
For $\( n \)$ observations $\( y_i \)$, the log-likelihood is:

#### **Parameter Estimation**
The score function for $\( \boldsymbol{\beta} \)$ is:

#### **Overdispersion**
A key assumption of Poisson regression is that $\( E(Y) = \text{Var}(Y) \)$. If the variance exceeds the mean (overdispersion), alternatives like **negative binomial regression** or **quasi-Poisson models** may be used.

### **4. Applications of GLMs and Poisson Regression**

#### **Applications of GLMs**
GLMs are widely used across fields due to their flexibility:
- **Logistic Regression**: For binary outcomes (e.g., disease presence/absence).
- **Poisson Regression**: For count data (e.g., number of customer complaints, disease cases).
- **Gamma Regression**: For positive, continuous data like insurance claim amounts.
- **Multinomial Regression**: For categorical outcomes with more than two levels.

#### **Applications of Poisson Regression**
Poisson regression is particularly useful for:
- **Epidemiology**: Modeling the number of disease cases in a population.
- **Traffic Studies**: Analyzing the number of accidents at intersections.
- **Marketing**: Predicting the number of customer purchases or responses to a campaign.
- **Ecology**: Modeling species counts in a habitat.

#### **Example: Poisson Regression**
Suppose we want to model the number of hospital admissions $(\( Y \))$ based on patient age $(\( X_1 \))$ and smoking status $(\( X_2 \)$, 1 for smoker, 0 for non-smoker). The model is:

<img width="319" height="44" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2efb9100-1842-4569-89f9-9a05bbd2b395" />


- $\( \lambda_i \)$ : Expected number of admissions for patient $\( i \)$.
- Fit the model using IRWLS to estimate $\( \beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2 \)$.
- Interpret $\( e^{\beta_1} \)$ : The multiplicative effect on the expected count for a one-unit increase in age.
- Interpret $\( e^{\beta_2} \)$ : The ratio of expected counts for smokers vs. non-smokers.

### **5. Implementation in Practice**

GLMs, including Poisson regression, are implemented in statistical software like R, Python, and SAS. Below is a brief example in Python using the `statsmodels` library for Poisson regression:

```python
import statsmodels.api as sm
import pandas as pd

# Sample data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'admissions': [0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 2, 1, 4],
    'age': [25, 30, 45, 22, 50, 35, 28, 60],
    'smoker': [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
})

# Add intercept
data['intercept'] = 1

# Fit Poisson regression
model = sm.GLM(data['admissions'], data[['intercept', 'age', 'smoker']],
               family=sm.families.Poisson()).fit()

# Summary of results
print(model.summary())
```

This code fits a Poisson regression model and provides parameter estimates, standard errors, and p-values.

### **6. Advantages and Limitations of GLMs**

#### **Advantages**
- **Flexibility**: Handles non-normal distributions and various data types.
- **Interpretability**: Coefficients can be interpreted in terms of the link function (e.g., log-odds in logistic regression, log-rates in Poisson regression).
- **Unified Framework**: Provides a consistent approach for different distributions.

#### **Limitations**
- **Assumption of Distribution**: The response must follow an exponential family distribution, which may not always hold.
- **Overdispersion**: Poisson regression assumes equal mean and variance, which may be violated.
- **Link Function Choice**: Misspecifying the link function can lead to poor model fit.

---

### **7. Conclusion**

GLMs extend linear regression by accommodating non-normal distributions through the exponential family and link functions. Poisson regression, a specific GLM, is ideal for count data and uses a log link to model the expected count. By leveraging maximum likelihood estimation and tools like IRWLS, GLMs provide a robust framework for modeling diverse data types. Applications span numerous fields, from epidemiology to marketing, making GLMs a cornerstone of statistical modeling.
