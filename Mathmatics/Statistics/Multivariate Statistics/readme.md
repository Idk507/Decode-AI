Multivariate Normal Distribution: Understanding joint distributions for multiple variables.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Dimensionality reduction technique to project data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving variance.

Factor Analysis: Modeling observed variables as linear combinations of latent factors.

Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA): Understanding the relationship between two sets of variables.
