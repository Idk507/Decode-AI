 **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
   - Convolution operations (kernels, padding, stride)
   - Pooling layers (Max, Average)
   - Modern architectures: 
     - LeNet → AlexNet → VGG → Inception → ResNet → DenseNet
   - Transfer learning (Fine-tuning)

 **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**
   - Sequential modeling concepts
   - LSTM/GRU cells (gating mechanisms)
   - Bidirectional RNNs
   - Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) models

. **Autoencoders & Embeddings**
   - Undercomplete/overcomplete architectures
   - Denoising/variational autoencoders (VAEs)
   - Embedding layers (Word2Vec, GloVe)
