Introduction to YOLO

Overview of YOLO as a real-time object detection framework.
Evolution from YOLOv1 (2016) to YOLOv8 and beyond (e.g., YOLOv9, YOLO-World).
Comparison with other detection frameworks (e.g., Faster R-CNN, SSD).
Key strengths: Speed, single-stage detection, end-to-end training.
Applications: Autonomous driving, surveillance, medical imaging, robotics.
