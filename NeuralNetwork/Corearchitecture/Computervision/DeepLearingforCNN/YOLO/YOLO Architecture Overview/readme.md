YOLO Architecture Overview

Backbone: Feature extraction CNN (e.g., Darknet, CSPDarknet, EfficientNet).

Connection to CNN architectures (as discussed).

Role of receptive fields in capturing multi-scale features (as discussed).

Neck: Feature aggregation (e.g., FPN, PANet) for multi-scale detection.

Head: Prediction layers for bounding boxes, objectness scores, and class probabilities.

Evolution of architectures across YOLO versions (e.g., Darknet-53 in YOLOv3, CSPDarknet in YOLOv5).
