Core Concepts of YOLO

Single-stage detection: Predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities in one forward pass.

Grid-based approach: Dividing the image into a grid for detection.

Anchor boxes: Predefined box shapes to predict object locations and sizes.

Intersection over Union (IoU): Metric for evaluating bounding box accuracy.

Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS): Filtering overlapping predictions.
