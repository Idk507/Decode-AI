YOLO Versions: Evolution and Innovations

YOLOv1: Basic grid-based detection, limitations in small object detection.

YOLOv2 (YOLO9000): Batch normalization (as discussed), anchor boxes, multi-scale training.

YOLOv3: Multi-scale predictions, Darknet-53 backbone, improved accuracy.

YOLOv4: CSPDarknet53, advanced augmentation (Mosaic), PANet neck.

YOLOv5: PyTorch implementation, dynamic anchor boxes, auto-learning anchors.

YOLOv6/YOLOv7: Optimized for edge devices, reparameterized heads.

YOLOv8: Unified framework for detection, segmentation, and classification; anchor-free options.

YOLOv9/YOLO-World: Advanced feature aggregation, open-vocabulary detection.
