### Example Code Outline (To Be Expanded if Requested)

For a practical example, here’s a high-level outline of training YOLOv5 on a custom dataset, incorporating the above topics:

```python
# Pseudo-code for YOLOv5 training
import torch
from yolov5 import YOLOv5  # Hypothetical import

# Define hyperparameters
hyperparams = {
    'lr': 0.01,  # Learning rate
    'batch_size': 16,
    'epochs': 50,
    'img_size': 640,  # Input size
    'weights': 'yolov5s.pt',  # Pre-trained weights (transfer learning)
    'augment': {'mosaic': True, 'flipud': 0.5, 'fliplr': 0.5}  # Data augmentation
}

# Load dataset (e.g., COCO format)
dataset = CustomDataset(data_dir='path/to/data', img_size=hyperparams['img_size'])

# Initialize model
model = YOLOv5(model_name='yolov5s', weights=hyperparams['weights'])

# Train model
model.train(
    dataset=dataset,
    batch_size=hyperparams['batch_size'],
    epochs=hyperparams['epochs'],
    lr=hyperparams['lr'],
    augment=hyperparams['augment']
