**Input Preprocessing for YOLO**
   - **Image Resizing** (as discussed):
     - Resize to fixed size (e.g., 416x416, 608x608) while preserving aspect ratio.
     - Letterbox padding to avoid distortion.
   - **Normalization**:
     - Scale pixel values to [0, 1] or dataset-specific stats.
   - **Data Augmentation** (as discussed):
     - Techniques: Mosaic augmentation, random scaling, flipping, color jitter.
     - Adjusting bounding boxes to match augmentations.
   - **Multi-Scale Training**:
     - Randomly resize inputs during training to improve robustness.
