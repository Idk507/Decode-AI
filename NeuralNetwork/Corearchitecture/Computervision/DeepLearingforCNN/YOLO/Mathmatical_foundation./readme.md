**Mathematical Foundations**
   - **Bounding Box Prediction**:
     - Predicting box coordinates $(\( x, y, w, h \))$ relative to grid cells.
     - Anchor box offsets: $\( t_x, t_y, t_w, t_h \)$.
   - **Loss Function** (as discussed):
     - Components: Localization loss (e.g., IoU-based), objectness loss, classification loss.
     - Example: YOLOv3 uses binary cross-entropy for classification, squared error for localization.
     - Advanced losses: CIoU, DIoU, GIoU (Complete, Distance, Generalized IoU).
   - **Receptive Fields** (as discussed):
     - Role of backbone and neck in achieving large receptive fields for multi-scale detection.
   - **Backpropagation** (as discussed):
     - Gradient computation for bounding box, objectness, and class predictions.
