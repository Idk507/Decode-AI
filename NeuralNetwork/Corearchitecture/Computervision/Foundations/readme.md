#### **Phase 1: Foundations**      
 **Image Processing Basics:**  
   - Digital image fundamentals (pixels, color spaces: RGB, HSV).  
   - Operations: filtering, edge detection (Sobel, Canny), transformations.
- **Image Representation**: 
  - Grayscale vs. color images.
  - Bit depth (e.g., 8-bit, 16-bit) and its impact on intensity levels.
  - Image formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP) and their compression characteristics.

- **Histogram Processing**:
  - Histogram equalization for contrast enhancement.  
  - Histogram matching for adjusting image intensity distributions.

- **Thresholding**:
  - Global thresholding (e.g., Otsuâ€™s method).
  - Adaptive thresholding for varying lighting conditions.

- **Morphological Operations**:
  - Dilation and erosion for shape manipulation.
  - Opening and closing for noise reduction or object separation.

- **Image Segmentation**:
  - Region-based segmentation (e.g., watershed algorithm).
  - Clustering-based methods (e.g., K-means).
  - Contour detection and boundary tracing.

- **Frequency Domain Processing**:
  - Fourier Transform for analyzing image frequency components.
  - Low-pass and high-pass filtering for smoothing or sharpening.

- **Image Restoration**:
  - Noise reduction (e.g., Gaussian noise, salt-and-pepper noise removal).
  - Deblurring (e.g., Wiener filter, inverse filtering).

- **Geometric Transformations**:
  - Scaling, rotation, translation, and shearing.
  - Affine and perspective transformations for image alignment.

- **Feature Extraction**:
  - Corner detection (e.g., Harris detector).
  - Blob detection (e.g., Laplacian of Gaussian, Difference of Gaussians).
  - Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) for keypoint detection.

- **Image Compression**:
  - Lossy vs. lossless compression techniques.
  - Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) used in JPEG.

- **Color Processing**:
  - Color balancing and white balance correction.
  - Color space conversions (e.g., RGB to CMYK, LAB).
  - Color quantization for reducing color palette.

- **Image Enhancement**:
  - Sharpening (e.g., unsharp masking).
  - Smoothing (e.g., Gaussian blur, median filtering).
  - Contrast stretching and gamma correction.

- **Template Matching**:
  - Cross-correlation for finding patterns or objects in images.

- **Image Registration**:
  - Aligning multiple images (e.g., for medical imaging or panorama stitching).

   - **Tools:** OpenCV, Pillow.  
   - *Project:* Build an image filter (e.g., blur, edge detection).
