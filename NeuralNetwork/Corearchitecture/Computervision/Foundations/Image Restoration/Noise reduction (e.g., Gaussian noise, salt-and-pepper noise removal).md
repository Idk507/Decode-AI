### Image Restoration: Noise Reduction (Gaussian Noise, Salt-and-Pepper Noise Removal)

**Image restoration** aims to recover a clean image from a degraded version, often corrupted by noise. **Noise reduction** is a critical restoration technique that removes unwanted variations in pixel intensities, such as **Gaussian noise** (smooth, random fluctuations) and **salt-and-pepper noise** (sparse, extreme pixel values). This explanation covers the mathematical concepts, practical applications, and a detailed Python code implementation using OpenCV and NumPy to demonstrate noise reduction techniques, including Gaussian blur for Gaussian noise and median blur for salt-and-pepper noise.

### 1. What is Noise Reduction?

Noise reduction techniques aim to suppress or remove noise while preserving the underlying image structure, such as edges and textures.

- **Gaussian Noise**:
  - Characteristics: Random variations in pixel intensities following a Gaussian (normal) distribution, often caused by sensor noise or low-light conditions.
  - Appearance: Grainy, continuous fluctuations across the image.
  - Reduction Method: Gaussian blur (spatial) or low-pass filtering (frequency domain) to smooth out random fluctuations.
- **Salt-and-Pepper Noise**:
  - Characteristics: Random pixels with extreme values (0 or 255), often caused by transmission errors or sensor defects.
  - Appearance: Black (pepper) and white (salt) specks scattered across the image.
  - Reduction Method: Median blur, which replaces pixel values with the median of their neighborhood, effectively removing outliers.
- **Purpose**:
  - Improve visual quality for human interpretation.
  - Enhance performance of downstream tasks like segmentation, object detection, or recognition.
- **Applications**:
  - Medical imaging (e.g., cleaning MRI or ultrasound images).
  - Photography (e.g., reducing noise in low-light images).
  - Satellite imagery (e.g., removing transmission artifacts).
  - Preprocessing for computer vision tasks.

### 2. Mathematical Concepts

Noise reduction techniques operate in either the **spatial domain** (directly on pixel values) or the **frequency domain** (using Fourier Transform). Below are the key methods for Gaussian and salt-and-pepper noise.

#### Gaussian Noise Reduction
- **Gaussian Blur (Spatial Domain)**:
  - Convolves the image with a Gaussian kernel to smooth pixel intensities:
    <img width="293" height="81" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c315913-6648-4e8a-9492-0d67e7103031" />

    Where $\( \sigma \)$ controls the smoothing strength.
  - Effect: Averages pixel values in a neighborhood, reducing random fluctuations.
  - Kernel size (e.g., 5x5) and $\( \sigma \)$ determine the degree of smoothing.
- **Low-Pass Filtering (Frequency Domain)**:
  - Applies a low-pass filter to the Fourier Transform to suppress high-frequency components (noise).
  - Filter: $\( H(u, v) = e^{-\frac{(u - u_c)^2 + (v - v_c)^2}{2\sigma^2}} \)$.
  - Covered in the previous topic (frequency domain processing).

#### Salt-and-Pepper Noise Reduction
- **Median Blur (Spatial Domain)**:
  - Replaces each pixel with the median value of its neighborhood (e.g., 3x3 or 5x5 window).
  - For a pixel $\( I(x, y) \)$ with neighborhood $\( N \)$, the output is:
    <img width="503" height="68" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e24a9db-3eb7-4d07-a7d9-bb59004ca099" />

  - Effect: Effectively removes extreme values (0 or 255) by selecting the median, which is robust to outliers.
- **Morphological Operations**:
  - Opening (erosion followed by dilation) can remove small white specks.
  - Closing (dilation followed by erosion) can fill small black holes.
  - Less effective than median blur for dense salt-and-pepper noise.

#### Example
Consider a 3x3 image with salt-and-pepper noise:
<img width="792" height="533" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8b95448-5c49-43bc-bf6a-6a150cd59eca" />

- **Median Blur (3x3)**:
  - For pixel (1, 1) = 120, neighborhood = [100, 255, 110, 0, 120, 130, 115, 125, 255].
  - Sorted: [0, 100, 110, 115, 120, 125, 130, 255, 255].
  - Median: 120.
  - Output:
   <img width="357" height="112" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75fb4d36-dcad-49e0-9ff1-a4d2460a7a40" />

  - Removes 0 and 255 outliers, preserving structure.

---

### 3. Practical Considerations
- **Gaussian Noise**:
  - Gaussian blur is effective but may blur edges; adjust kernel size and $\( \sigma \)$ carefully.
  - Low-pass filtering in the frequency domain is an alternative but computationally intensive.
- **Salt-and-Pepper Noise**:
  - Median blur is highly effective for sparse outliers; use a small kernel (e.g., 3x3 or 5x5) to preserve details.
  - Morphological operations can complement median blur for specific noise patterns.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Convert color images to grayscale or process channels separately.
  - Analyze noise type (e.g., visual inspection, histogram) to choose the appropriate filter.
- **Parameter Tuning**:
  - Gaussian blur: Kernel size (odd, e.g., 5x5) and $\( \sigma \)$ (e.g., 1–2).
  - Median blur: Kernel size (e.g., 3x3 for light noise, 5x5 for heavy noise).
- **Applications**:
  - **Gaussian Noise**: Smooth noisy medical images or low-light photos.
  - **Salt-and-Pepper Noise**: Clean images with transmission errors or sensor defects.
- **Limitations**:
  - Gaussian blur may over-smooth, reducing edge sharpness.
  - Median blur may distort fine textures with large kernels.

### Code Explanation
1. **Loading Image**:
   - Loads a grayscale image using `cv2.imread` with `cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE`.

2. **Adding Noise**:
   - **Gaussian Noise**: Adds random noise from a normal distribution $(\( \mu = 0, \sigma = 25 \)$) using `np.random.normal`.
   - **Salt-and-Pepper Noise**: Randomly sets 2% of pixels to 255 (salt) or 0 (pepper).

3. **Noise Reduction**:
   - **Gaussian Blur**: Applies a 5x5 Gaussian kernel with $\( \sigma = 1.5 \)$ to smooth Gaussian noise.
   - **Median Blur**: Applies a 5x5 median filter to remove salt-and-pepper noise.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Displays the original image, noisy images (Gaussian and salt-and-pepper), and filtered images.

5. **Pixel Value Output**:
   - Prints pixel values at (100, 100) for all images to show the effect of noise and filtering.

---

### Prerequisites
- Install required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
  ```
- Provide an image file (`image.jpg`) in the same directory or update the `image_path` variable. Use a grayscale image with clear details for meaningful results.

---

### Expected Output
- A figure with five subplots:
  - Original grayscale image.
  - Image with Gaussian noise $(\( \sigma = 25 \))$.
  - Gaussian blurred image (smoothed).
  - Image with salt-and-pepper noise (2% probability).
  - Median filtered image (noise removed).
- Printed pixel values, e.g.:
  ```
  Pixel at (100, 100):
  Original Grayscale: 113
  Gaussian Noise: 125
  Gaussian Filtered: 112
  Salt-and-Pepper Noise: 255
  Median Filtered: 114
  ```

### Practical Notes
- **Gaussian Noise**:
  - Gaussian blur kernel size (e.g., 5x5) and $\( \sigma \)$ (e.g., 1–2) control smoothing strength.
  - Larger kernels or $\( \sigma \)$ increase smoothing but may blur edges.
- **Salt-and-Pepper Noise**:
  - Median blur kernel size (e.g., 3x3 for light noise, 5x5 for heavy noise) affects noise removal and detail preservation.
  - Larger kernels remove more noise but may distort textures.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Analyze noise type via histogram or visual inspection:
    - Gaussian noise: Smooth, bell-shaped histogram deviations.
    - Salt-and-pepper noise: Spikes at 0 and 255.
  - Convert color images to grayscale or process channels separately.
- **Applications**:
  - **Gaussian Noise**: Smooth low-light photos, preprocess medical images.
  - **Salt-and-Pepper Noise**: Clean images with sensor or transmission errors.
- **Limitations**:
  - Gaussian blur may over-smooth edges; consider edge-preserving filters (e.g., bilateral).
  - Median blur may distort fine details with large kernels.

  Robust to outliers like salt-and-pepper noise.
- **Frequency Domain Alternative**:
  - Low-pass filtering (previous topic) can reduce Gaussian noise but is less effective for salt-and-pepper noise.

---

### Extensions
- **Bilateral Filtering**: Preserve edges while smoothing Gaussian noise:
  ```python
  img_bilateral = cv2.bilateralFilter(img_gaussian_noise, 9, 75, 75)
  ```
- **Non-Local Means**: Advanced denoising for Gaussian noise:
  ```python
  img_nlm = cv2.fastNlMeansDenoising(img_gaussian_noise)
  ```
- **Morphological Operations**: Combine with opening/closing to refine noise removal.
- **Color Images**: Apply filters to each RGB channel or use LAB/HSV for better results.
- **Quantitative Evaluation**: Measure noise reduction using PSNR or SSIM.
