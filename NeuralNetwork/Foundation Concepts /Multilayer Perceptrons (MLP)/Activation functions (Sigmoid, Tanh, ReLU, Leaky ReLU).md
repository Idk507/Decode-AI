Activation functions are critical components in neural networks, including Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), as they introduce non-linearity, enabling the network to model complex patterns. Below is an overview of four common activation functions—**Sigmoid**, **tanh**, **ReLU**, and **Leaky ReLU**—including their definitions, mathematical forms, properties, advantages, and limitations.

### 1. **Sigmoid**
- **Definition**: Maps input values to the range (0, 1), often used for binary classification or probabilistic outputs.
- **Mathematical Form**:

- **Derivative**:

- **Properties**:
  - Output range: (0, 1).
  - Smooth, continuous, and differentiable.
  - Historically used in early neural networks for its probabilistic interpretation.
- **Advantages**:
  - Outputs can be interpreted as probabilities, useful for binary classification.
  - Smooth gradient aids in backpropagation.
- **Limitations**:
  - **Vanishing Gradient**: For large positive or negative inputs (\( |z| \gg 0 \)), the gradient approaches 0, slowing learning in deep networks.
  - **Non-Zero-Centered**: Outputs are always positive, which can make gradient updates less efficient.
  - **Computationally Expensive**: Involves exponentials, which are costly to compute.
- **Use Cases**: Output layers for binary classification, logistic regression-like tasks.

### 2. **tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)**
- **Definition**: Maps input values to the range (-1, 1), a scaled and shifted version of the sigmoid.
- **Mathematical Form**:
 <img width="401" height="93" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a77cf061-908f-417f-b5ba-9356d726c61b" />

- **Derivative**:
<img width="341" height="53" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fc92baf-fdd6-4d0d-ac3f-efe100d66854" />

- **Properties**:
  - Output range: (-1, 1).
  - Zero-centered, unlike sigmoid.
  - Smooth and differentiable.
- **Advantages**:
  - Zero-centered outputs improve convergence in gradient-based optimization compared to sigmoid.
  - Captures negative relationships due to its symmetric range.
- **Limitations**:
  - **Vanishing Gradient**: Like sigmoid, gradients become small for large \( |z| \), hindering deep network training.
  - **Computationally Expensive**: Requires exponential calculations.
- **Use Cases**: Hidden layers in smaller networks, tasks where negative outputs are meaningful.

### 3. **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**
- **Definition**: Outputs the input if positive; otherwise, outputs 0. Most widely used in modern deep learning.
- **Mathematical Form**:
  <img width="374" height="93" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d8bf011-1ce9-4640-8c4f-1f3b6f0864b2" />

- **Derivative**:
<img width="350" height="119" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1afc8f2b-b99a-4111-a640-f8104fc148d6" />

- **Properties**:
  - Output range: [0, ∞).
  - Non-linear but not differentiable at $\( z = 0 \)$ (subgradient used in practice).
  - Simple and computationally efficient.
- **Advantages**:
  - **Avoids Vanishing Gradient**: Linear for positive inputs, ensuring non-zero gradients.
  - **Sparse Activation**: Only activates for positive inputs, reducing computation and improving efficiency.
  - **Fast Convergence**: Accelerates training compared to sigmoid or tanh.
  - **Computationally Cheap**: No exponentials, just a thresholding operation.
- **Limitations**:
  - **Dying ReLU Problem**: Neurons with negative inputs output 0, and if weights cause persistent negative inputs, the neuron may "die" (stop learning due to zero gradients).
  - **Non-Zero-Centered**: Outputs are always non-negative, which can bias updates.
  - **Unbounded Output**: Large positive outputs can lead to instability in some cases.
- **Use Cases**: Hidden layers in deep neural networks (e.g., CNNs, MLPs), default choice for most modern architectures.

### 4. **Leaky ReLU**
- **Definition**: A variant of ReLU that allows a small, non-zero gradient for negative inputs to address the dying ReLU problem.
- **Mathematical Form**:
 <img width="410" height="91" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54b628ed-13ce-4471-b14d-5b2a72b34068" />

  where $\( \alpha \)$ is a small positive constant (e.g., 0.01).
- **Derivative**:
 <img width="421" height="124" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0af5813d-e888-4209-8fc4-94c6e6fab38b" />

- **Properties**:
  - Output range: (-∞, ∞).
  - Non-linear, with a small slope for negative inputs.
  - Variant: Parametric ReLU (PReLU) learns $\( \alpha \)$ during training.
- **Advantages**:
  - **Mitigates Dying ReLU**: Non-zero gradient for negative inputs keeps neurons active.
  - **Sparse Activation**: Like ReLU, only a subset of neurons activate, maintaining efficiency.
  - **Computationally Efficient**: Simple thresholding with a small modification.
- **Limitations**:
  - **Hyperparameter $\( \alpha \)$ **: Choosing or learning $\( \alpha \)$ adds complexity (though often fixed at 0.01).
  - **Non-Zero-Centered**: Like ReLU, outputs are not symmetric around zero.
  - **Still Unbounded**: Large positive outputs can cause issues.
- **Use Cases**: Hidden layers in deep networks, especially when ReLU leads to dying neurons.

### Comparison Table

| **Activation** | **Output Range** | **Gradient Range** | **Pros** | **Cons** |
|----------------|------------------|--------------------|----------|----------|
| **Sigmoid**    | (0, 1)          | (0, 0.25)         | Probabilistic output, smooth | Vanishing gradient, non-zero-centered, expensive |
| **tanh**       | (-1, 1)         | (0, 1)            | Zero-centered, smooth       | Vanishing gradient, expensive |
| **ReLU**       | [0, ∞)          | {0, 1}            | Fast, avoids vanishing gradient, sparse | Dying ReLU, non-zero-centered, unbounded |
| **Leaky ReLU** | (-∞, ∞)         | {$\(\alpha\)$, 1}   | Mitigates dying ReLU, sparse | Hyperparameter tuning, non-zero-centered |

### Practical Considerations
- **ReLU** is the default choice for hidden layers in most deep learning models due to its simplicity and effectiveness, especially in convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
- **Leaky ReLU** or **PReLU** is used when dying ReLU is observed (e.g., in deeper networks or specific datasets).
- **Sigmoid** is typically used in output layers for binary classification or when probabilistic outputs are needed.
- **tanh** is less common but useful in tasks where zero-centered outputs are beneficial (e.g., recurrent neural networks).
- **Choosing an Activation**: Depends on the task, network depth, and dataset. Experimentation and validation are key.

### Example: XOR with MLP
To illustrate how these activation functions work in an MLP for the XOR problem:
- **Architecture**: 2 input neurons, 2 hidden neurons, 1 output neuron.
- **Hidden Layer Activation**: ReLU or tanh (sigmoid is less effective due to vanishing gradients).
- **Output Layer Activation**: Sigmoid (for binary output).
- **Training**: Backpropagation adjusts weights to form a non-linear decision boundary. ReLU converges faster than tanh, while Leaky ReLU can help if some neurons become inactive.
