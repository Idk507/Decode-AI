## Optimization for Reinforcement Learning: PPO and TRPO

### 1. Introduction to PPO and TRPO

**Reinforcement Learning Overview**:
In RL, an agent interacts with an environment modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) defined by:
- **States** $(\( \mathcal{S} \))$: The set of possible states.
- **Actions** $(\( \mathcal{A} \))$: The set of possible actions.
- **Transition dynamics** $(\( p(s' | s, a) \))$ : Probability of transitioning to state $\( s' \)$ from state $\( s \)$ after action $\( a \)$.
- **Reward function** $(\( r(s, a) \))$: Reward received for taking action $\( a \)$ in state $\( s \)$.
- **Policy** $(\( \pi(a | s; \theta) \))$: A mapping from states to actions, parameterized by $\( \theta \)$, which can be deterministic or stochastic.
- **Objective**: Maximize the expected cumulative discounted reward:

  - $\( \gamma \in [0, 1) \)$ : Discount factor.
  - $\( \mathbb{E}_{\pi_\theta} \)$ : Expectation over trajectories induced by policy $\( \pi_\theta \)$.

**Policy Gradient Methods**:
PPO and TRPO are policy gradient methods, which optimize the policy by computing gradients of $\( J(\theta) \)$ :
<img width="558" height="100" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e340a918-3a72-4f75-8fee-48925f2323ae" />

- $\( A^\pi(s_t, a_t) \)$: Advantage function, estimating how good an action is compared to the average action in state $\( s_t \)$ .
- Common advantage estimator: $\( A(s_t, a_t) = Q(s_t, a_t) - V(s_t) \)$ , where $\( Q \)$ is the action-value function and $\( V \)$ is the state-value function.

**PPO and TRPO**:
- **TRPO**: Ensures stable policy updates by constraining the policy change using a trust region, enforcing a KL-divergence constraint to prevent large, destabilizing updates.
- **PPO**: Simplifies TRPO by using a clipped objective or KL penalty, balancing stability and computational efficiency.

### 2. Mathematical Foundations

#### 2.1 Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)

**Objective**:
TRPO optimizes the policy by maximizing a surrogate objective while ensuring the new policy \( \pi_{\theta'} \) stays close to the old policy \( \pi_\theta \). The surrogate objective approximates the expected improvement:
<img width="412" height="79" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5268a3af-1480-431f-a701-c1967d00814c" />

- $\( \frac{\pi_{\theta'}(a_t | s_t)}{\pi_\theta(a_t | s_t)} \)$: Importance sampling ratio.
- $\( A^\pi(s_t, a_t) \)$: Advantage estimated under the old policy.

**Constraint**:
TRPO constrains the policy update to a trust region defined by the KL-divergence between the old and new policies:
<img width="438" height="52" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c93a7ef9-9117-4f45-b49f-21cb54a318e2" />

- $\( \text{KL} \)$ : Kullback-Leibler divergence.
- $\( \delta \)$ : Trust region size (e.g., 0.01).

**Optimization Problem**:
<img width="592" height="76" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7979913-2a39-4879-942c-f7400e6564a8" />

TRPO solves this using the conjugate gradient method to approximate the Fisher information matrix and enforce the KL constraint.

**Update Rule**:
The policy update is computed as:
<img width="209" height="48" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60719f75-5441-4014-b0e8-eefc385c23ed" />

- $\( \mathbf{d} \)$ : Search direction, computed via conjugate gradient to maximize $\( L(\theta') \)$ within the trust region.
- $\( \alpha \)$ : Step size, determined via line search to satisfy the KL constraint.

#### 2.2 Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

**Objective**:
PPO simplifies TRPO by using a clipped surrogate objective to limit policy updates, avoiding the need for complex trust region optimization. The clipped objective is:
<img width="916" height="210" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c125a98b-981b-42d3-99fd-673ca29a8631" />


**Alternative Objective (PPO-Penalty)**:
Instead of clipping, PPO can use a KL penalty:
<img width="694" height="50" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/914ab16f-4575-4c7c-9b57-55a56f8b13ec" />

- $\( \beta \)$ : Adaptive penalty coefficient, adjusted based on the KL divergence.

**Value Function Loss**:
PPO often includes a value function loss to train a critic:
<img width="315" height="70" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd4d734b-7165-4f00-b70e-a85022a69fa7" />

- $\( V_\phi(s_t) \)$ : Predicted value function.
- $\( R_t \)$ : Discounted cumulative reward (or advantage target).

**Total Loss**:
<img width="443" height="89" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9526292c-3572-400b-ba3b-93d6e763188a" />

- $\( c_1, c_2 \)$ : Coefficients for value loss and entropy bonus (to encourage exploration).
- $\( S[\pi_{\theta'}] \)$ : Policy entropy.

**Update Rule**:
Parameters are updated using a standard optimizer (e.g., Adam):
<img width="226" height="60" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc95564e-3d78-4216-a06b-1e3e245448a4" />

### 3. Key Optimizations in PPO and TRPO

#### 3.1 TRPO Optimizations
- **Trust Region Constraint**:
  - Enforces stability by limiting policy changes via KL divergence.
  - Optimization: Tune $\( \delta \)$ (e.g., 0.01–0.1) to balance stability and progress.
- **Conjugate Gradient**:
  - Approximates the inverse Fisher matrix for efficient trust region updates.
  - Optimization: Use a small number of conjugate gradient steps (e.g., 10) to reduce computation.
- **Line Search**:
  - Adjusts step size to ensure the KL constraint is satisfied.
  - Optimization: Implement backtracking line search for robust updates.
- **Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)**:
  - Estimates advantages with:
   <img width="620" height="88" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6f08b72-3e16-4ea1-9c38-9672c511a54e" />

    - $\( \lambda \)$ : GAE parameter (e.g., 0.95) to balance bias and variance.
  - Optimization: Tune $\( \lambda \) and \( \gamma \)$ for stable advantage estimates.

#### 3.2 PPO Optimizations
- **Clipped Objective**:
  - Limits policy updates by clipping the importance ratio, simplifying TRPO’s trust region.
  - Optimization: Tune $\( \epsilon \)$ (e.g., 0.1–0.3) to control update size.
- **Adaptive KL Penalty** (PPO-Penalty):
  - Adjusts $\( \beta \)$ dynamically based on observed KL divergence.
  - Optimization: Set target KL (e.g., 0.01) and update $\( \beta \)$ to maintain it.
- **Value Function Clipping**:
  - Clips value function updates to stabilize critic training:
    <img width="678" height="66" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7081620-dea4-4010-819d-c467410858a7" />

  - Optimization: Tune clipping parameter $\( \epsilon_v \)$.
- **Entropy Bonus**:
  - Adds policy entropy to encourage exploration.
  - Optimization: Tune $\( c_2 \)$ (e.g., 0.01) to balance exploration and exploitation.
- **Multiple Epochs**:
  - Performs multiple gradient updates (e.g., 10 epochs) on collected trajectories.
  - Optimization: Balance number of epochs and batch size for efficiency.

#### 3.3 Common Optimizations
- **Actor-Critic Architecture**:
  - Use separate or shared networks for policy (actor) and value function (critic).
  - Optimization: Share early layers to reduce parameters, but separate heads for flexibility.
- **Normalization**:
  - Normalize rewards or advantages to reduce variance.
  - Optimization: Apply running mean and standard deviation normalization.
- **Parallel Environments**:
  - Collect trajectories from multiple environments in parallel to increase sample efficiency.
  - Optimization: Use vectorized environments (e.g., Gym’s VecEnv).
- **Learning Rate Scheduling**:
  - Use linear or cosine decay to stabilize training.
  - Optimization: Tune initial learning rate (e.g., $\( 3 \times 10^{-4} \)$ for PPO).

### 4. Example: PPO and TRPO in CartPole

**Task**: Train an agent to balance a pole on a cart in the CartPole-v1 environment (OpenAI Gym).
- **State**: $\( \mathbf{s} \in \mathbb{R}^4 \)$ (cart position, velocity, pole angle, angular velocity).
- **Action**: Discrete (left or right).
- **Reward**: +1 per timestep until failure.
- **Goal**: Maximize episode length (up to 500).

**PPO Approach**:
- Use a neural network with two heads: policy (softmax over actions) and value function.
- Collect trajectories over 2048 timesteps, compute GAE advantages $(\( \lambda = 0.95 \))$.
- Optimize with clipped objective $(\( \epsilon = 0.2 \))$, 10 epochs per update, Adam with $\( \eta = 3 \times 10^{-4} \)$ .
- Outcome: Achieves ~500 reward (max episode length) after ~100,000 timesteps.

**TRPO Approach**:
- Use a similar network, but optimize with trust region constraint $(\( \delta = 0.01 \))$ .
- Compute conjugate gradient updates with 10 steps, use line search for KL constraint.
- Outcome: Similar performance to PPO but with higher computational cost.

### 5. Advantages of PPO and TRPO

**TRPO**:
- **Stability**: Trust region constraint ensures safe policy updates, avoiding catastrophic changes.
- **Theoretical Guarantees**: Monotonic improvement in policy performance under certain conditions.
- **Robustness**: Performs well in complex environments with continuous actions.

---

### 6. Limitations of PPO and TRPO

**TRPO**:
- **Computational Cost**: Conjugate gradient and line search are computationally expensive.
- **Complexity**: Implementation is more complex than PPO, requiring careful tuning of $\( \delta \)$ .
- **Scalability**: Less suitable for very large networks or datasets due to second-order computations.

**PPO**:

### 9. Code Explanation

The code implements PPO for CartPole-v1 using PyTorch:
- **Model**: Actor-critic network with shared layers, outputting action logits and state values.
- **PPO Agent**: Implements clipped objective, GAE, and multiple epochs per update.
- **Training**:
  - Collects 2048 timesteps, computes GAE advantages (\( \lambda = 0.95 \)).
  - Updates policy for 10 epochs with clip parameter \( \epsilon = 0.2 \).
- **Outcome**: Achieves ~500 reward (max episode length) after ~50,000–100,000 timesteps.

**Running the Code**:
- Install dependencies: `pip install torch gym`
- Run the script to train the agent. Monitor episode rewards to track progress.
- Expected outcome: Consistent 500 reward, indicating successful policy learning.

---

### 10. Practical Considerations
